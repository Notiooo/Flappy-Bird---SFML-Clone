\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file is everything that is related to the window application -\/ for example handle exit buttons, resizing the window etc. 

A window where the game should be displayed.

The window deals with displaying the game. It does not manage anything related to the game gameplay itself, and its maximum interference with the game itself is displaying the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_state_stack}{State\+Stack}}, and loading states used in the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_state_stack}{State\+Stack}}.

It also holds Manager for Texture and Fonts -- so they can be used anywhere inside the window.
