# Flappy Bird  - SFML Clone

The first ever game I've created in the SFML library for a class project from a 5-week (2 classes a week each) programming class for the 3rd semester of the Informatics at Silesian University of Technology.

## Source of knowledge
The game is based on the framework "Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML)". Knowledge about the library itself was collected mainly from SFML documentation, as well as from the book *SFML Game Development* published in June 2013 by the publisher Packt, and the authors: *Jan Haller, Henrik Vogelius Hansson, Artur Moreira*. Smaller or larger errors were fixed with use of questions and problems from sites such as StackOverflow and sometimes from the official SFML forum.

## What is the status of the current game?
Bad... The current game is in a bad stage due to the relatively short time allocated to the project. Many aspects have been badly implemented due to the time compromises.

All this will probably be improved in the future.

## External Specification

### How to play 
It is a program made using a graphical library. Just run its executable file (.exe). The control is not too complicated. **The main button is the spacebar,** which allows you to make the first bird flap and each subsequent one. The spacebar also starts the second attempt after the result of the finished approach is displayed.

### How to pause
To pause the game all you need is to **press the ESC key.**

### How to quit 
To quit the game you have to **press the ESC key (pause) and then the Enter key.**
